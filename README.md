# Kenwood Steering Wheel Control
 This repository contains documentation on Kenwood's "proprietary" Steering Wheel Control (SWC) interface

Please note, this is a work in progress, and links may be broken

See [/Protocol.md](https://github.com/x13-me/Kenwood-Steering-Wheel-Control/blob/main/Protocol.md) for protocol info

See [/Mappings.md](https://github.com/x13-me/Kenwood-Steering-Wheel-Control/blob/main/Mappings.md) for information on mappings, reverse engineered on KDC-BT34U, believed to be the same across all kenwood units

See [/HowTo.md](https://github.com/x13-me/Kenwood-Steering-Wheel-Control/blob/main/HowTo.md) for information on how this protocol was reverse engineered, and how to ensure *your* radio is compatible

See [x13-me/Kenwood-SWC-Arduino](https://github.com/x13-me/Kenwood-SWC-Arduino) for an Arduino implementation of this protocol
